## Introduction

There are two baseline types of filters for this design. First, the Successive Interference Cancellation spectrum analysis filter for the FunCube+ design, for Mode Dynamice Transponder, lead by @martinling. Second, the communications channel style filter for Haifuraiya, the HEO/GEO satellite project from ORI.
